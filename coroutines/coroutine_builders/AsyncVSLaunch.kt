// https://kotlinlang.org/docs/composing-suspending-functions.html#structured-concurrency-with-async

/**
 * Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines.
 * Note while coroutines are run concurrently with each other, each coroutine's block of code/body is executed *sequentially*.
 *
 * The difference between launch  and async is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value,
 * while async returns a Deferred â€” a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a promise to provide a result later.
 * You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed.
