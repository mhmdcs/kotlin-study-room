/*Synchronized block statements take any object as their lock, and use the lock to execute their code-block. these blocks have
 the advantage of being more fine-grained (as they are more scoped). In the code below, synchronized(this)
 defines `this` (the Incrementerâ€™s instance) as the lock object. Any thread that reaches this point, locks the Incrementer instance,
 then does the work defined in the synchronized block, and then releases the lock.*/
